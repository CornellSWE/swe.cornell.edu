      <h4>Outreach</h4>
        <p>
	  SWE Outreach strives to bring STEM education and awareness to individuals of all ages throughout Cornell and the greater Ithaca community. By partnering with groups within the community, we hope to influence a diverse audience of young people, parents, teachers, and mentors to pique and sustain their interest in STEM. On campus, we strive to attain a college-wide awareness of the challenges underrepresented minorities face in STEM, taking steps toward racial and gender parity by leveraging connections with other Diversity Programs in Engineering.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In the past we have partnered with Girl Scouts of NYPENN, Ithaca High School Code Red Robotics, Tompkins County Public Library, Junior FLL, SWE NEXT clubs, and many others. We are always looking for more partnership opportunities!
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also involved with the recruitment of incoming women engineers to the College of Engineering at Cornell. Every year we run Women in Engineering Day for accepted students. The goal of this program is to expose admitted women to the opportunities at Cornell and the influence and strength of our section of SWE.
