                    <p>Why I joined SWE: I first heard of SWE in high school, and from it I learned more about engineering 
                      and connected with other girls passionate about STEM. Therefore, I was excited to join SWE as a freshman 
                      at Cornell. Since then, I have made so many friends through this organization that has created a community 
                      for me within engineering and beyond. I am passionate about providing resources and mentoring for younger 
                      girls interested in engineering, and I love the space that SWE creates for this type of programming. </p>

                      for the opportunities that SWE presented. I appreciate all the networking opportunities we have, and 
                      the ability to help a community within engineering have a solid path to their future interests and jobs. 
                      SWE has also provided me with leadership opportunities to work within a community and aid in my professional 
                      development.</p>
