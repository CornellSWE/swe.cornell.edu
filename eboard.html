                    <p>Why I joined SWE: I joined SWE because I wanted to surround myself with an amazing community of women in the science and engineering field. I am passionate about encouraging the next generation of girls to pursue STEM and engineering, and SWE gives me the 
                      opportunity to reach out to women and girls in the Ithaca community, and all around the world.</p>

                      I was excited to join SWE as a freshman, 
                      and since then I have enjoyed getting to meet other female engineers and develop proffesional skills.</p>

                      especially since I have experienced firsthand the lack of gender diversity in engineering. 
                      I joined SWE to help create more opportunities for women engineers and be part of their supportive 
                      community! </p>

                      Being part of this society offers me unique opportunities for professional development, mentorship, 
                      and leadership training that are tailored to the challenges and opportunities faced by women in the 
                      engineering field. It provides a platform for me to advocate for the inclusion and success of women in 
                      engineering, both in academia and the industry. Furthermore, it allows me to contribute to a larger 
                      movement that encourages young girls to pursue careers in STEM, thereby promoting diversity and 
                      innovation within the field.</p>
