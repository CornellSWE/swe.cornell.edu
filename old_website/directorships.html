          The Fundraising Directorship is responsible for raising money to send our members to the annual SWE National Conference and to help support the many other events on campus that our organization hosts.

          SWE Student Services works to build a strong SWE community to provide members with necessary resources to succeed during their time at Cornell.

	<p>
	  Our internal mentorship program matches underclassmen to upperclassmen with similar interests and major course of study. This allows for upperclassmen to share their experiences and provide advice to help facilitate their mentees’ transition to college while fostering interconnectivity.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Social events throughout the year include Halloween-themed apple cider and leaf painting, movie outings, cookie decorating, and an annual Escape Room charity fundraiser.

      <h4>Outreach</h4>
        <p>
	  SWE Outreach strives to bring STEM education and awareness to individuals of all ages throughout Cornell and the greater Ithaca community. By partnering with groups within the community, we hope to influence a diverse audience of young people, parents, teachers, and mentors to pique and sustain their interest in STEM. On campus, we strive to attain a college-wide awareness of the challenges underrepresented minorities face in STEM, taking steps toward racial and gender parity by leveraging connections with other Diversity Programs in Engineering.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In the past we have partnered with Girl Scouts of NYPENN, Ithaca High School Code Red Robotics, Tompkins County Public Library, Junior FLL, SWE NEXT clubs, and many others. We are always looking for more partnership opportunities!
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also involved with the recruitment of incoming women engineers to the College of Engineering at Cornell. Every year we run Women in Engineering Day for accepted students. The goal of this program is to expose admitted women to the opportunities at Cornell and the influence and strength of our section of SWE.
