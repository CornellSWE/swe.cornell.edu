		<p>The Public Relations directorship seeks to spread SWE's name on the campus by publicizing events through various means, 
		such as postering, sending electronic mailings weekly to inform members of future events, designing and maintaining the website, etc.  
		The goal is to keep students informed on upcoming SWE activities and opportunities through SWE. </p>
						
		<p>The Public Relations directorship also includes <a href="faculty.asp">Faculty Relations</a>. This branch connects students 
		and faculty through various social events, allowing SWE members to network and get to know their professors.</p>

		<p>Included within Public Relations is also Alumni Relations. Alumni Relations connects Cornell SWE alumni with current
members through various programs and events.</p>
		
		<p>We also create <a href="podcasts.asp">Podcasts</a>.Podcasts are short videos of interviews with SWE
members in different majors, which many freshmen and sophomore members find
helpful when deciding a major. Check out our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CornellSWE" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> for more Cornell SWE videos!</p>
