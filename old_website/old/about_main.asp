<h1>About Us</h1>
		
		<p>The Cornell Student Section of the Society of Women Engineers was charted on November 9, 1972. 
		Since then, we have grown to be one of the largest student organizations on campus.  Membership for SWE is open to undergraduate 
		and graduate students (both male and female) in engineering, physics, chemistry, and computer science. </p>
                                        
        	<p>Each year, we run numerous programs and events to promote engineering, diversity, career
and professional development, academic support, and pre-college education. These include
many outreach programs in and around the Ithaca community, various social programs, dinners,
luncheons, and over 100 company information sessions. For more information about all the
programs that we run, please check out "the Eboard" section.</p>
	<p>Every semester Cornell SWE publishes a newsletter. Here are some recent editions:</p>
