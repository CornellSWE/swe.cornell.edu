<h1>Sponsor SWE!</h1>

<h3>How Can You Benefit?</h3>
Your contributions will help sponsor the wide variety of events that Cornell SWE holds, and promote
your company to the wider Cornell community. Younger students who benefit from our Outreach
evetns will develop corporate awareness and associate a potential future to their interests in science
and technology. Support in the form of event materials, such as T-shirts, project kits, and takeaways
will generate plenty of publicity for your company and help us plan exciting interesting, and engaging
events.
<br/><br/>
Holding an information session or sponsoring a Cornell SWE general body meeting allows you to
reach out to a vast collection of bright individuals whose values could align with your company’s. As a
Diamond Sponsor, you could have your company name and logo displayed on our general body T-shirts,
worn by nearly 150 Cornell SWE members! In addition, Cornell SWE T-shirts are worn at almost every
event we organize.
<br/><br/>
By supporting Cornell SWE, you will be helping to develop the future of science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology, by helping our members to become more well-rounded, socially-aware,
conscientious citizens of the STEM community.
<br/><br/>
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING CORNELL SWE!
