		Richardson joined the faculty in January, 2002, after finishing her Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the
		University of California at Berkeley, where she also received her M.S. Her B.S. in Chemical Engineering was earned at 
		Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York. She has had internships as both a Chemical Engineer with Air Products and 
		Chemicals and an Environmental Consultant with Malcolm Pirnie Consultants.
		<br /><br />
		The Richardson lab studies the activities of microbial communities through the study of genomics, transcriptomics 
		and proteomics. The main techniques used by the lab are quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR) to assay RNA 
		pools and high throughput shotgun proteomics (via tandem mass spectrometry) of whole community peptides. Together these 
		methods provide a wealth of information about the enzymes and other proteins being expressed by individual populations 
		within a consortium of organisms. Additionally, the lab employs flourscence in situ hybridization with 16S rRNA-targeting 
		probes in order to visualize and count specific populations in mixed communities. By applying multiple probes 
		simultaneously, researchers are able to visualize biofloc and biofilm co-localization of different phylogenetic groups.
		<br /><br />
		The main application of these "omics" is the study of consortia containing Dehalococcoides ethenognes - the first 
		organism shown to bioremediate chlorinated ethenes (perchloroethene - PCE - and trichloroethene - TCE) to harmless ethene 
		gas. However, many of the techniques can be applied to track microbes involved in biogeochemical cycling in the environment 
		and biofuel/bioenergy production in controlled reactors.
