<h1>Sponsor SWE!</h1>

<h3>Sponsor a SWE Outreach Program</h3>
Cornell SWE’s Outreach Directorship strives to promote the science, technology, math and engineering
(STEM) fields to students of all ages by bringing interactive experiments to elementary, middle, and
high schools in and around the Ithaca area. Throughout the academic year, the Outreach Directorship
organizes and participates in 19 events. In the past year, we were able to expand several popular
existing programs like our annual Girl Scout Day and Women in Engineering Weekend programs, to
include more students and more activities. In the 2011-2012 academic year, we have introduced the
Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS) Competition, a nation-wide competition and educational
program that exposes high school students to real-world applications of engineering concepts. These
expansions and additions to our event schedule would not be possible without your continued support!
Sponsoring an Outreach event is an effective way to reach out to a younger audience and allow them to
associate their interests with a future career in an established company. Some of these Outreach events
are summarized below.<br/><br/>
