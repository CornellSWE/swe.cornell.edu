		Claire received her B.S. in Computer Science in 1982 at Yale University and her M.S. in Computer Science in 1989 
		at the University of Massachusetts. She continued her education at the University of Massachusetts, and, in 1994, 
		she obtained her Ph.D. in Computer Science. Cardie is currently a professor in the Department of Computer Science.
		<br /><br />
		Cardie's primary research is in the area of natural language understanding and intelligent text processing where 
		her goal is to develop algorithms and systems that will vastly improve a user's ability to find, absorb, and extract 
		information from on-line text. Her group's research generally proceeds at two complementary levels: they focus both on 
		building real systems for large-scale natural language processing tasks and on developing techniques to address 
		underlying theoretical problems in syntactic and semantic analysis of natural language. In particular, her group 
		is investigating the use of machine learning techniques as tools for guiding natural language system development and 
		for exploring the mechanisms that underlie language understanding. Her group's work encompasses a number of related areas: 
		the machine learning of natural language, extraction and summarization of opinions from text, tuning of NLP systems to 
		arbitrary performance metrics, and the design of user-trainable systems that can efficiently and reliably extract the 
		important information from a document.
		<br /><br />
		Currently, her group is working on noun phrase coreference (within-document and cross-document), weakly supervised 
		learning methods for NLP, and building opinion-oriented question-answering and summarization systems. Some of her research 
		has focused directly on the development of new machine learning techniques. In particular, some of the group's research in 
		this area has addressed: the use of problem-specific constraints to improve clustering, weakly supervised learning paradigms,
		feature weighting and feature selection for case-based learning algorithms, and minority class prediction, i.e. dealing 
		with skewed data.
