<h1>School Outreach</h1>
<p>At school, we not only learn about American history and adverbs but interact with others and mature. SWE Outreach hopes to further this personal growth by helping students find what they might like to do in the future. With our enthusiasm about engineering, we want to encourage students to pursue further education in science, math, and engineering.
<br/><br/><strong>Elementary</strong><br/>
Reaching out to our youngest audience, we hope to pique their interest at a young age in fun and exciting activities. We hope to visit them and teach them all about science without them even knowing! We visit their classrooms and bring hands on activities.
<br/><br/><strong>Middle School</strong><br/>
<br/><br/>
<strong>High School</strong><br/>
High School is the place where decisions are made and we hope to positively interact with students in class rooms to encourage them to move break up the lectures and book studies with hands on activities.
