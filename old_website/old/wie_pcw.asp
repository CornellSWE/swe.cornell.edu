<h1>Women in Engineering Weekend and Prospective Candidates Weekend</h1><p>
<strong>Women in Engineering Weekend</strong><br/>
What might we want to do after high school? When do we decide what we might like to major in? And honestly, what is engineering school? Our Women in Engineering Event hopes to dispel some of that mystery by bringing high school students to our campus to see the real deal. They are exposed to different types of engineering and the opportunities that come from pursuing an engineering degree. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Prospective Candidates Weekend</strong><br/>
Congratulations, you have been admitted into college but what is the best fit for you? What is life as a Cornell engineer like? What would you be doing and who would you be interacting with every day? This event brings young women on campus to see just that. This event hopes to encourage women to pursue engineering degrees and to find the best fit for them. We hope it’s Cornell but we hope to educate and let the girls discover where they may fit best.
