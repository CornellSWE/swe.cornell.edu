		McKee received her bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Yale University (1985), master's from Princeton 
		University (1990), and doctorate from the University of Virginia (1995). 
		<br /><br />
		Before graduate school, McKee worked for Digital Equipment Corporation's Personal Computer Division and Microsoft 
		Corporation. She has also held internships at Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center and the former 
		AT&T Bell Labs (now Lucent Technologies Bell Labs). McKee worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in the University 
		of Virginia Computer Science Department for a year after graduating (waiting for the chip to come back from fab), and 
		as a Computer Architect at Intel's Microcomputer Research Lab in Oregon for the two following years. During her time at 
		Intel, McKee also taught at the Oregon Graduate Institute and Reed College. She was a Research Assistant Professor at 
		the University of Utah on the Impulse Adaptable Memory Controller project. She joined Cornell University's Computer 
		Systems Lab within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in July 2002.
		<br /><br />
		McKee's research has focused mainly on analyzing application memory behavior, and designing more efficient memory 
		systems and the software to exploit them. Achieving this broad objective requires developing new underpinnings for 
		system understanding: she and her students are currently developing new approaches to performance analysis, building 
		better and more scalable tools for application analysis and system modeling, designing architectures to enable more
		comprehensive system analysis, and designing efficient memory systems for both parallel and uniprocessor 
		(including embedded) platforms.
