        <p>The Cornell University Society of Women Engineers proudly presents our semiannual
Professional Networking Dinner. We cordially invite you to join a talented and
eager group of students in this unique networking opportunity. Held the evening
before Cornell's technical career fair, the Professional Networking Dinner enables
company representatives and students to interact in an intimate yet relaxed environment.
This allows representatives to share personal and business experiences while seeing
first hand just what Cornell has to offer.</p>

<p>This year, the event will be held on Monday, February 3rd, at the Statler Hotel's Grand Ballroom, located on the Cornell University Campus, from 7:30-9:30PM. The event will cost $180.00 for the first company representative and $160.00 for each additional representative. Please note that each company is limited to a maximum of 4 company representatives. Companies may also choose to purchase a black and white advertisement to be included in the program. Half page ads 4(5"x4") cost $40 and full page ads (5"x8") cost $60. Dinner and four networking rotations will allow you to meet a wide variety of students in a casual and friendly atmosphere. Representatives are invited to stay an additional half hour, until 10:00pm, for further networking. This is a priceless opportunity for Cornellians to meet company representatives, ask questions, and learn directly from professionals with experience in the corporate world.
