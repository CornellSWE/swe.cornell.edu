	<h3>SMART Scholarship</h3><p>
Dear Cornell University Faculty, Undergraduate/Graduate Coordinators, Department Chairs, and Administrators:
<br/>
I write to make you aware of a tremendous scholarship-for-service opportunity for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students and to request that you encourage your best students to apply to the SMART Scholarship Program.  This is a highly-selective, prestigious, national program that fully supports their education, including full tuition and a very generous stipend while they are in school.
 <br/><br/>
The Science, Mathematics, And Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship-for-service Program fully funds undergraduate and graduate degrees in a wide range of technical areas, including all fields of Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and Mathematics.   
 <br/><br/>
A SMART brochure is attached and the application web page is at <a href="http://www.asee.org/SMART">http://www.asee.org/SMART</a>.  The application deadline is December 2010 for the 2011 school year.  SMART provides:
 <br/><br/>
-Full Tuition - to any accredited U.S. University<br/>
-A very generous stipend while in school<br/>
-$25,000 for undergraduates<br/>
-$33,000 for masters candidates<br/>
-$33,000 to $41,800 for doctoral candidates<br/>
-Book allowance - $1,000<br/>
-Health Insurance<br/>
-Paid Summer internships<br/>
-All required student fees<br/>
-Travel fees for internships<br/><br/>
Summer internships at the facility/laboratory are required.  In return for fully funding their education, students are required work as a civilian employee at a Service (Army, Navy, Air Force) or DoD Agency (NSA, DIA, DARPA, etc.) laboratory, or similar activity, for a period equal to the time the program paid for their school.  Students must be U.S. Citizens, able to obtain a DoD Security Clearance, and be willing to work in a defense facility/laboratory upon graduation. 
<br/><br/>
There will be approximately 300 new awards this year.  A list of SMART fellows from previous years is listed by University at:

While Cornell is one of the top schools in terms of SMART recipients, I think we can greatly increase the number of your students supported in this program.  I would appreciate your help in disseminating this information to your students, faculty, undergraduate advisors, and graduate coordinators, and by encouraging your best students to apply for this tremendous opportunity.
<br/><br/>
