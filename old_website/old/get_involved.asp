		<p>Chair and liason applications for the 2011-2012 year are posted below. The application deadline is Friday, Sept. 9th at 11:59pm.  All chairs will need to attend the mandatory chair training on Sunday, Sept. 11th at 7pm.<br/><br/>
		Becoming a chair or liason is a great way to become more involved with SWE and will give you the opportunity to network with faculty and 
		employers, or just meet more of your fellow SWE members or volunteer and introduce engineering to younger girls.  
		There are many positions available so check out the descriptions.<br/><br/>
