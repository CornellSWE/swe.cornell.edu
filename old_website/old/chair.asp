<h3>Become a Chair</h3>
Cornell SWE has eight different directorships, seven of which have chairs to help them carry out their
responsibilities. These directorships are public relations, student services, outreach, fundraising, career
development, and graduate SWE. More information about each directorship can be found <a href="http://swe.cornell.edu/eboardtest.asp">here</a>.
<br/><br/>
To be a chair and list this on your resume you must also be a national member. Click <a href="http://swe.cornell.edu/testjoin.asp">How to Join</a>

Most chair positions are a one year commitment. Most applications are due at the beginning of the academic year
but a few are due at the end of the previous academic year. Feel free to <a href="http://swe.cornell.edu/eboardtest.asp">contact any directors</a> if you have questions.
