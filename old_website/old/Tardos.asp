		Professor Tardos earned her doctorate degree in 1984 at Eotvos University (Budapest, Hungary) and 
		then soon after, she held a Humboldt Fellowship at the University of Bonn and a postdoctoral fellowship 
		at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at Berkeley University. Tardos joined Cornell University?s 
		teaching faculty in 1989 and is now a member of the graduate field of Operations Research.
		<br /><br />
		Tardos?s research interests include the design and analysis of efficient methods for combinatorial 
		optimization problems on graphs and networks. She is also interested in fast combinatorial algorithms that 
		provide optimal or close-to-optimal results. Some of Professor Tardos?s recent projects have included 
		algorithmic game theory, a new area of designing systems and algorithms for users.
