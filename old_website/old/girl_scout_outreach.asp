<h1>Girl Scout Outreach</h1><p>
With our Junior Girl Scout and Brownie Girl Scout committees, SWE Outreach hopes to incite young girl scouts in the Ithaca area by bringing them to campus for a fun filled day. Through different hands on activities, the girls earn a “Try-It” or Jr. badge and explore problem solving and engineering. It’s a great way to interact with each other and work on team building. There is even a segment of the program designed for the parents with our local professional Twin Tiers Sections comes and speaks with the parents.
