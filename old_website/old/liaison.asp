<h3>Become a Liaison</h3>
Liaisons have the opportunity to meet and work with recruiters one-on-one before the sessions even begin! They
are responsible for running company information sessions, and arrive before the session to set up and stay after
to clean up. Setup for sessions includes bringing supplies from the office, putting out beverages and catered food,
setting up basic video or LCD equipment, and helping out with any needs the recruiters may have. Each session
generally requires about two hours total. This year we expect to host about 60 information sessions, mostly in the
fall. In order to ensure that we can cover all the sessions, we expect each liaison to sign up for a minimum of three
info sessions in the fall and at least one in the spring.
<br/><br/>
All liaisons must be national SWE members. Click <a href="http://swe.cornell.edu/testjoin.asp">How to Join</a>
to become one. Liaisons who complete the minimum requirement will receive a $20 reimbursement at the end of the year for their national
membership.
<br/><br/>
Applications are due at the beginning of the academic year.
