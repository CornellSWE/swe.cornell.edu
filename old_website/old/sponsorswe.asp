<h3 id="presLetter">Letter from the Presidents</h3>

Dear Company Representatives & Alumni,<br/><br/>
We are pleased to inform you that, in the past year, the Society of Women Engineers at Cornell
University (Cornell SWE) has continued to be extremely active in preserving our professional image by
impacting our local community, fostering great relationships with our supportive corporate sponsors,
and strengthening the bond between women engineers on the Cornell University campus.<br/><br/>
As we strive to maintain our presence in the Ithaca community, our membership and event repertoire
have been steadily growing. For the 2011-2012 academic year, we are dedicated to developing the
following areas of Cornell SWE:

<ul>
<li>Visibility and Attendance at 2011 SWE National Conference</li>
<li>Professional and Career Development for Undergraduate Students</li>
<li>Development of the SWE Graduate Branch</li>
<li>Outreach Directorship Expansion</li>
</ul>

<img src="imagesnew/pres.png" class="floatParagraph"/> Just as the engineering community prides itself on being the driver of
innovation, we are committed to providing women with the
necessary resources for success. Out achievement relies on not only the
dedication and leadership of our members, but also the participation and
engagement of our corporate sponsors and alumni.<br/><br/>

We invite you to be a part of our growth, and very much look forward to working with you soon.<br/><br/>

Warm Regards,<br/><br/>

Kerianne Dobosz and Carolyn Chu<br/>
Cornell SWE President and Vice President
