<h3>Study Groups</h3>
Prelims and Finals Are Coming Up…Are You Prepared?<br/><br/>
We are putting together study groups for Math 1910/1920, CS 1110/1112, Chem 2090, and Phys 1112. If you are interested in tutoring or being tutored, send your NetID and interested courses to anm73@cornell.edu or sak247@cornell.edu. There will be snacks for those who attend, but non-SWE members will be charged $2 for the snacks.

<h3>Undergrad-Graduate Mentoring Program</h3>
Are you an undergrad worried about what the future holds?
Looking for advice on what classes to take, what jobs to apply for, or how to apply to grad school?
Help is here!<br/><br/>
Join the Society of Women Engineers Undergrad-Graduate Mentoring Program.
This program aims to pair up individual undergraduate engineering students with graduate students willing to help and mentor those seeking help with classes, job/internship search, grad school applications and much more. We hope this will be the start of a path to bridging the gaps between the engineering undergraduate and graduate student populations. There will be a kick-off event after Thanksgiving, where each mentor-mentee pair will be able to meet and begin the building the mentoring relationship. More information will be announced in the upcoming weeks.
<br/><br/>
All interested undergrads should sign up here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aocq9q0oJx5adHAzNG1nc1h5dXREeUdaX0ZCQnZnVkE">

We are also in need of grad students to be mentors. If you are a grad student, and would like to become involved in this program, please sign up here:
