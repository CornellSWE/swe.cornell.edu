		Chekesha Liddell received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with Highest Distinction from Spelman College (1999) 
		and a Bachelor of Materials Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology (1999), [Atlanta University Center, 
		Dual Degree Engineering Program]. She was awarded the NASA Women in Science and Engineering Scholarship to support 
		her undergraduate work. Liddell also held three internship appointments at NASA, Kennedy Space Center in the Cryogenics 
		and External Tank Branch and the Microchemical Analysis Laboratories. She joined the Cornell University faculty in
		November of 2003, after receiving a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering with a minor in Science and Technology 
		Policy from Georgia Tech. 
		<br /><br />
		The Liddell group research efforts focus on the development of colloid-based materials (using synthetic chemistry, 
		surface modification, self-assembly and field-directed assembly) and on understanding the relationship between their 
		structure and properties to provide engineering solutions for the micron and submicron length scales. They integrate 
		fundamental science in the areas of inorganic and organic chemistry, interface science, materials science (principles 
		for electronic, optical, magnetic, mechanical behavior of materials), condensed matter physics, and thermodynamics to 
		design and fabricate materials for applications requiring low cost manufacture with performance tied to control of 
		micro- and nanostructures. In particular, we address the limitations in achieving optimum photonic crystal materials 
		for photonic technologies such as optical integrated circuits, light sources, photocatalysts, and solar cells.
