<h1>Sponsor SWE!</h1>

<h3>Host a Career Development Event</h3>
Focused on aiding member of Cornell SWE in the area of professional advancement, the Career
Development Directorship hosts a variety of events throughout the school year. These events strive to
teach business etiquette, networking skills, and career information in an effort to guide SWE members
through their career path. Through a variety of different events, such as the Professional Networking
Dinner and the Etiquette Dinner, SWE members learn how to interact with company representatives
and how to best present themselves.
<br/><br/>
One of our most attended events it the our Professional Networking Dinner, which enables company
representatives and students to interact in a relaxed environment and allows representatives to
share personal and business experience while seeing firsthand just what Cornell has to offer. Three
dinner “shifts” allow recruiters to meet a wide variety of students in a casual and friendly atmosphere
over dinner and dessert. This is a priceless opportunity for Cornell students to meet company
representatives, ask questions, and learn directly from professional with experience in the corporate
world.
