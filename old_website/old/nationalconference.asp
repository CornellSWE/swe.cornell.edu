<h3>Send a Member to the SWE National Conference</h3>
Cornell SWE annually sends member of its executive board to the SWE National Conference, held
this past October in Chicago, IL. The conference provides Cornell engineering women with many
opportunities, such as the chance to network with company representatives and other SWE chapters,

to interact with and learn from other SWE members, both collegiate and professional. In the past,
discussion with other collegiate member have helped Cornell SWE directors learn from other collegiate
sections about best practices, organizational structure, and innovative events in an effort to improve the
Cornell Section. Conversations with professional members highlighted the diversity of the engineering
field, and keynote speakers became inspirational examples of the opportunities available and the
possibilities for success. For students just beginning their engineering careers, conferences offers a
wide range of activities, workshops, and opportunities designed to showcase the multitude of career
paths open to engineers and aid the students in their professional development. Technical tours and
demonstrations are offered by companies who have local representation at the conference location.
