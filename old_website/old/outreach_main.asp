<h1>Outreach</h1>
		<p>Cornell SWE's Outreach Directorship strives to reach out the community and bring excitement to people of all ages about science and engineering.  Working toward improving the future, strengthening interest, and inspire young individuals, SWE Outreach organizes 19 events ranging from programs for elementary aged kids all the way up to high school seniors.  The Outreach directorship reaches out to the general Ithaca community to encourage women to enter the technical world while having fun and engaging activities. These programs also reach students as young as elementary school to high school students.   SWE members volunteer and work with other special interest groups on Cornell’s campus.  They engage the community to raise awareness about engineering. Outreach connects SWE as an on campus organization to the community.</p>

		<p>We target schools, clubs like girl scouts, and even programs open to the entire state of NY.  Some events are visits to schools and others include having the students come for a weekend.  For example or Women in Engineering Weekend is a time where high school juniors come to campus and are hosted overnight by current students.  We have social events, mock classes, student panels, and even lab demonstrations where they can learn about engineering and the opportunities that come with this field. </p>
