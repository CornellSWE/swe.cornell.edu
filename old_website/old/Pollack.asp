		After receiving her Ph.D., Professor Pollack came to Cornell to work with the Low Temperature Physics group 
		as a Postdoctoral Associate (1989-1991) and as a Research Associate (1991-1997) in the Microkelvin Laboratory. 
		In 1997, with support from the NSF and the LASSP Biophysics Group, she changed the focus of her research program 
		to Biophysics. In 1999 she became Senior Research Associate in LASSP. She joined the faculty in Applied and Engineering 
		Physics in 2000. She is affiliated with the Nanobiotechnology Center and with CHESS (G-line).  
		<br /><br />
		Her group is studying both self-assembly/folding of macromolecules and conformational changes associated with 
		biological function.  We develop and use new tools to trigger and monitor shape changes to access novel information 
		about these processes. 
		<br /><br />
		Using micro/nanofabrication techniques, the Pollack research group produces flow cells with mixing times of 
		microseconds. Flexibility of design makes it possible to use these rapid mixers in conjunction with different 
		probes of macromolecular structure, including x-ray scattering and fluorescence. One of her major initiatives is the 
		use of synchrotron small angle x-ray scattering to measure the time dependence of the size and shape of macromolecules 
		(proteins and nucleic acids) as they fold. With this new technique, it is now possible to characterize transient states 
		that occur during the folding process. Information of this type is critical for comparison of experiment to untested 
		theories of the initial events in macromolecular folding.
