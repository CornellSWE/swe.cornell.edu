<h1>Community Outreach</h1>
<p>
What makes Cornell University one of the best places to be? The surrounding Ithaca community that supports this wonderful institution and Cornell SWE tries give back! SWE Outreach engages with the community in various ways to raise awareness and more. 
<br/><br/><strong>Community Outreach Liaisons</strong><br/>
The Cornell community is truly a wonderful and diverse place with varying interest groups and many engaging minds. What better way is there then working together and sharing expertise to make a great impact on the community?
<br/><br/>
<strong>Community Outreach Program Chairs</strong><br/>
This section of the Outreach directorship works to make a lasting impression through recurring events. Some of these programs include the Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program (STOMP), Habitat for Humanity Women Builds, Lights Off Cornell!, and a new series of outreach podcasts which we hope to pilot this year.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Community Outreach Event Chairs</strong><br/>
What better way to incite diverse and unique tastes than with a variety of different activities? The Event Chairs work to organize various one-day events where the community can engage in science and engineering. The Event Chairs organize an annual trip to the Ithaca Sciencenter.<br/><br/>
