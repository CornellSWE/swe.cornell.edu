		Before joining the faculty at Cornell, van der Meulen worked for three years as a biomedical engineer at the 
		Rehabilitation R&amp;D Center of the Department of Veterans Affairs, in Palo Alto, California. As a graduate 
		student at Stanford University, she received a NASA Graduate Student Researchers Fellowship and her experiments 
		were conducted at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. In 1995 she received an NIH FIRST Award 
		and in 1999 an NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award. She has presented her research at the 1997 NAE Frontiers 
		of Engineering Symposium and the Gordon Conferences for Bioengineering and Orthopaedic Science and for Ceramics. 
		van der Meulen is a member of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, the American and European Societies 
		of Biomechanics, American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Orthopaedic Research Society.

		Traditionally, biomechanics has focused on examining the material and structural properties of living tissues, both 
		in their normal and diseased states. This approach is primarily one of mechanics and is relevant to understanding the 
		load bearing ability of tissues. Dr. van der Meulen?s work in this area focuses on understanding the role of tissue 
		mechanical behavior on skeletal structural performance, as well as the role of particular tissue constituents (growth 
		factors and other matrix molecules) on whole bone function. Recently, interest has refocused on the other side of the 
		problem: understanding how mechanical forces influence skeletal structure. Van der Meulen works extensively on in vivo 
		models of skeletal functional adaptation to mechanical stimuli and methods to assess this adaptation.
