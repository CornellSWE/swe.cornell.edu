<h2>About Each Directorship</h2>
<h4>Public Relations</h4>
The Public Relations directorship keeps the campus, alumni, faculty, and anyone outside of
Cornell and/or SWE informed about all the great opportunities that Cornell SWE provides. This mainly entails
advertising events, creating podcasts, hosting faculty relations socials, keeping alumni in the loop, and maintaining
the website, the SWE Directors Blog, and Cornell SWE’s social networking accounts.
<br/>
<h4>Outreach</h4>
Cornell SWE's Outreach Directorship strives to reach out the community and bring excitement to people
of all ages about science and engineering. Working toward improving the future, strengthening interest, and
inspire young individuals, SWE Outreach organizes 19 events ranging from programs for elementary aged kids all
the way up to high school seniors.
<br/><br/>
The Outreach directorship reaches out to the general Ithaca community to encourage women to enter
the technical world while having fun and engaging activities. These programs also reach students as young as
elementary school to high school students. SWE members volunteer and work with other special interest groups
on Cornell’s campus. They engage the community to raise awareness about engineering. Outreach connects SWE
as an on campus organization to the community. We target schools, clubs like girl scouts, and even programs
open to the entire state of NY. Some events are visits to schools and others include having the students come for
a weekend. For example or Women in Engineering Weekend is a time where high school juniors come to campus
and are hosted overnight by current students. We have social events, mock classes, student panels, and even lab
demonstrations where they can learn about engineering and the opportunities that come with this field.
<br/>

<h4>Student Services</h4>
The Student Services directorship works to connect all SWE members. Student services
organizes socials, facilitates mentorship program among upperclassmen and underclassmen, and also run
various philanthropy events on campus, such as community services and other fundraising events for non-profit
organizations.
<br/>
<h4>Fundraising</h4>
The Fundraising directorship contacts companies in an effort to find funding to travel to the SWE
National and Regional Conference. We strive to strengthen SWE relationships with corporate sponsors.
<br/>
<h4>Career Development</h4>
The Career Development directorship aims to enhance SWE members' skills in their career
path by guiding them through various events, such as the <a href="pnd_main.asp">Professional Networking Dinner</a>, etiquette lunch, and
industry panels. They also connect SWE to corporations and build strong relationships between the students and
companies. Career Development's goal is to shape SWE members and guide them in finding for a career.
<br/>

<h4>Finance</h4>
The Finance directorship is in charge of all the financing within SWE. This includes all the money
transactions from numerous events, ranging from information sessions, industry panel, national and regional
conferences, outreach/community service events, and many others.<br/><br/>
This year, the Finance Directorship is taking a step forward. By utilizing the latest software and
technology, we hope to make SWE’s financial structure better than ever. Yes! That’s right. Electronic billing and
payment. Life just got a lot easier. SWE has recently partnered with Cornell Business Services to provide electronic
payment options for companies holding recruitment info sessions or corporate sponsored events. Here’s how it
works: After organizing an event through SWE, a personalized URL link will be sent to you via email. This link will
include an invoice, summary of purchase, and secure credit card payment option. The transaction will then be
immediately processed and a confirmation page will be available for you to store in your records. It’s that easy! We
will still be accepting checks, but hopefully this electronic system will make payments easier for you.

<h4>Graduate SWE</h4>
This branch was created during the fall semester of 2010. Even though we are young, we have a
lot of great ideas and are continuing to grow. Come to one of our events to see what we are all about! We aim to
provide support to women pursuing graduate degrees in engineering through social, networking, outreach, and
professional development events. Our <a href="http://www.graduateswe.blogspot.com">Cornell Graduate SWE blog</a> provides information about how to get involved,
information about our upcoming events, and more!
