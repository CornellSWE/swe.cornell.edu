		Dr. Apsel received a Ph.D. from The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore in 2002. She is currently the Clare Luce 
		Boothe Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University and heads the Optoelectronic 
		VLSI Laboratory at Cornell.
		<br /><br />
		Her current research interests include optoelectronic CMOS systems and architectures, short distance interconnects, 
		low power RF systems, robust mixed mode circuit design, and high speed CMOS interfaces. She holds two patents, has 
		received a best paper award at the 2000 Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, a best paper award at ASYNC 2006, 
		a "Top Picks" paper from IEEE MICRO in 2006, an NSF Early Career Award in 2004, and has been named to MIT Technology 
		Review's top 100 young innovators for 2004. She is also an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems 
		I, a member of the Science and Engineering Council of the OSA, and a member of the technical program committees for SPIE 
		Optics East, Photonics West, IEEE LEOS meeting, and IEEE ISCAS.
		<br /><br />
		The current research of the Optoeclectronic VLSI Laboratory includes Short Distance Optical Interconnect, Power 
		Optimized Circuits and Systems, and Circuits for Reduced Process Variability.
		<br /><br />
		She is currently teaching a course titled ?Advanced Analog VLSI Circuit Design,? ECE554.
