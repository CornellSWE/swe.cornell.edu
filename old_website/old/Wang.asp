		Wang received her doctorate in Physics from University of Chicago in 1996. She was a NSF-NATO postdoctoral 
		fellow in theoretical physics at University of Oxford in 1996-1997 and a visiting member at New York University's 
		Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1997-1999, before joining the Cornell faculty in 1999. She is a member 
		of the American Physical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. She is a recipient of a NSF 
		Early Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, and a David and Lucille Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering.
		<br /><br />
		Her research aims to identify, investigate, and discover new phenomena in a broad range of physical and biological systems. 
		One of her current interest is to understand the intricacies of unsteady aerodynamics through insect flight and falling 
		leaves. Other themes of her research include turbulence, computational fluid dynamics, localization in disordered systems, 
		and general spectral theory of non-Hermitian random matrices and its application to advection-diffusion systems.
