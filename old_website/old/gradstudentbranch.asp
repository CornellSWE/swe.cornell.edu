<h3>Formation of a Graduate Student Branch</h3>
Cornell University’s College of Engineering’s Graduate School is a well-known and respected institution
that produces high-achieving and intelligent engineer for both industry and academia. Last year the
formation of a graduate student SWE branch, named the Graduate Directorship, provided women
students the opportunity to experience the benefits and rewards of Cornell SWE’s close-knit community,
as well as to participate in professional and personal development events, networking programs and
socials catered to their needs.
<br/><br/>
The formation of our Graduate Directorship was extremely well-received by graduate students, who
enjoyed the chances to socialize with various member of the Cornell Engineering community, including
graduate students outside of their field of expertise, undergraduate engineering students through the
Peer Mentorship program, and advisor at career development presentations.
<br/><br/>
The Graduate Directorship, now in its second year, plans to develop a leadership pipeline that will
represent graduate students from all stages of the advanced academic degree. The development of
Graduate Student branch will increase the visibility and publicity opportunities for our section and
expand our audience at our career development events and corporate relations company information
session to include both undergraduate and graduate students.
