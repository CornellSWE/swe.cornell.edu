		Professor Kedem is a visiting professor from Ben-Gurion University, Israel. She received her Ph.D from Tel Aviv 
		University in 1989, where she was trained in Mathematics and Computer Science, and specialized in the area of 
		Computational Geometry. 
		<br /><br />
		Her research area is computational geometry with applications to problems in computer vision and bioinformation. 
		The attempt to deal with practical problems (like shape comparison) by investigating their geometric nature yields a 
		better theoretical understanding of the problems and provides sound and efficient algorithms. Among the theoretical 
		problems she works on are problems in geometric optimization, such as covering a set of points by a given number of shapes 
		and facility location. In the last three years she has looked into shape comparison problems in three dimensions. 
		Such problems arise in many life-science disciplines. In computational molecular biology she have come up with a new metric, 
		the URMS, to measure substructure resemblance between proteins. This measure has been implemented and further applied to 
		the analysis of molecular dynamics. It proves superior to previously used measures. With the Department of Life Sciences 
		at Ben Gurion University she have been looking at dendrite shape comparison and classification.
