		Professor Ahner received her doctorate degree in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at 
		Massachusettes Institute of Technology. She then spent two years as a research associate in the Department of 
		Geology at Princeton University. Professor Ahner’s research mainly concerns “intracellular detoxification mechanisms 
		and pollutant effects on aquatic microalgae and crop plants.” She is also very passionate about issues such as 
		“phytoremediation,” which is the using of plants to remove metals from contaminated areas.
		<br /><br />
		Professor Ahner currently teaches a sophomore introductory engineering course titled “Engineering Applications 
		in Biology Systems.” She also teaches the “Bioremediation: Engineering Organisms to Clean Up the Environment,” 
		a course reserved for graduate students.
