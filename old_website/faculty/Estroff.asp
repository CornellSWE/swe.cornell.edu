		Assistant Professor Estroff earned her Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry at Swarthmore University and doctorate 
		degree in Chemistry at Yale University. Before joining Cornell’s faculty, Assistant Professor Estroff was an NIH 
		funded postdoctoral fellow in George Whiteside’s laboratory at Harvard University. Estroff is currently performing 
		research projects in the area of bio-inspired materials synthesis. She is mainly focusing on the integration of 
		self-assembled monolayers with natural hydrogels to create systems where both the nucleation and crystal growth are 
		controlled. Estroff is also interested in the design and creation of peptides to inhibit pathological mineralization 
		and to control the growth of organic crystals. Estroff is teaching an undergraduate course titled Materials Chemistry, 
		MSE 204, in addition to creating a new course centered around the study of biomineralization and biomaterials, which 
		will open up to students in Spring of 2007.
