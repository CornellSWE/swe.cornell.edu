		Paulette Clancy received her B.Sc. in 1974 at London University, United Kingdom. She then earned her D.Phil. 
		in 1977 at Oxford University, United Kingdom. She did her Postdoctoral Research at Cornell University from 1978 
		to 1984. Clancy is currently a professor and the William C. Hooey Director at Cornell University.
		<br /><br />
		The Clancy group focuses on multiscale computational studies of traditional (silicon-based) and non-traditional 
		(organic) semiconductors, especially the optimization and understanding of manufacturing processes used to fabricate 
		electronic devices and design potentially improved semiconductor materials. The major emphasis of the group is on 
		atomic-scale modeling, but multi-scale techniques are used to cover multiple length- and time- scales. The group’s 
		studies are always closely coupled to experimental investigations undertaken in the lab of a collaborator, providing 
		students the opportunity to combine computation and experimentation and to study with our collaborators, including 
		international studies. The impact of the group’s work is felt in the semiconductor fabrication industries (IBM, 
		Applied Materials, Intel, Motorola, etc.), in the growing OLEDs display market (Kodak, DuPont, etc.). The Clancy group 
		also has a long-standing interest in the energy/sustainability arena through its studies of greenhouse gases trapped 
		in the permafrost as hydrates. A new project will leverage the group's expertise into a study of hydrogen storage materials.
