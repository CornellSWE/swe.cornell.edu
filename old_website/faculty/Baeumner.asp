		After receiving her Ph.D. Dr. Baeumner came in 1997 to Cornell University to join Richard Durst’s research group 
		in the Dept. of Food Science and Technology in Geneva, NY. In 1999 she became an assistant professor in the Dept. 
		of Biological and Environmental Engineering. She teaches courses at the interface of the life sciences and engineering, 
		such as BEE 260 “Principles of Biological Engineering” and BEE 459/659 “Biosensors and Bioanalytical Techniques”. 
		<br /><br />
		Dr. Baeumner’s research focuses on the development of biosensors and micro-Total Analysis Systems (mTAS) for the 
		detection of viable pathogenic organisms in food, the environment and in clinical diagnostic. Pathogens of interest 
		range from Cryptosporidium parvum to Dengue virus to B. anthracis. Molecular biological recognition of the pathogenic 
		organisms is integrated with micro- and nanofabricated devices in order to develop portable analytical systems for field 
		use. A group of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students is working on projects investigating highly specific 
		mRNA sequences of pathogens and how to amplify their presence using molecular biological techniques, modeling and designing
		micromixers, developing micropotentiostats, develping novel cell lysis systems based on lasers, and combining all of this 
		for the development of a mTAS. In another application, the group is developing rapid diagnostic assays related to HIV/AIDS
		diagnostics by detecting and quantifying the amount of CD4+-T-lymphocytes in patients’ blood. Funded through the 
		Gates Foundation, this test is designed for use in resource-limited countries.
		<br /><br />
		Outside of her research, Dr. Baeumner is enjoying time with her two little children, loves to play the piano and enjoys 
		the beautiful Finger Lakes Region by running up and down the many hills with her husband Richard. He enticed her to run 
		in her first marathon in 1999, the 24th Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C. finishing just under 4 hours.
