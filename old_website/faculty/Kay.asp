		Kay was a postdoctoral fellow and assistant professor at the University of California at Los Angeles before coming to 
		Cornell in 1976. in 1983, she was a visiting associate in petrology at the California Institute of Technology. In 1989, 
		she was a Fulbright fellow at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. She is a fellow of the Geological Society of 
		America (GSA) and the Mineralogical Society of America, an honorary foreign member of the Geological Association of 
		Argentina, and a member of the American Geophysical Union and the Society of Economic Geologist. She is a recipient of 
		the GSA Distinguished Service Award.  Among other activities, she has been a member of the GSA council and the US 
		National Committee for Geological Sciences, the science editor of GSAToday,  the co-chair of the 2006 GSA-Asociación 
		Geológica Argentina “Backbone of the Americas” meeting in Argentina,  the GSA International Secretary and on the 
		editorial boards of a number of journals. She received her B.S (1969) and M.S. (1972) from Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
		She then earned her Ph.D. in 1975 from Brown. She is currently a professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
		<br /><br />
		Her research concentrates on the applications of geochemistry, petrology and mineralogy to problems of the origin 
		and evolution of the continental crust, with particular emphasis on the relation of regional tectonics to magmatic 
		processes, arc magmatism, continental margins, the formation of the lower crust, and the evolution of ore deposits.  
		The research couples field studies and chemical and isotopic analysis and is often integrated with geophysical and 
		structural studies.
