          <h4>Student-Faculty Dinner</h4>
          <p>
            SWE Student-Faculty dinner is an opportunity for students to interact face-to-face with professors from all
            engineering
            disciplines in one of the largest student-faculty social events organized by students. With a focus on
            female faculty as
            a way to introduce more tangible role models to students, over ten professors from across the College of
            Engineering
            will come together with students and discuss academics, career paths, research, entrepreneurship, work-life
            balance,
            advice, what it is like to be a woman in STEM, and more, in an intimate and casual environment.

          <h4>Alumni Mentorship Program</h4>
          <p>
            Interested in building connections with Cornell SWE alumni? Receive advice from a fellow SWEster and learn
            about their
            career journey! Here about their time at Cornell and where it has taken them. The SWE Alumni Mentorship
            program is a
            great way to expand your network of fellow engineers! We are customizing this program to offer you lots of
            different
            ways to interact with the alumni, including one-on-one meetings and large group networking events.

          <h2> Outreach</h2>
          <h4>Junior Girl Scout Day</h4>
          <p>
            Last semester, our committee planned a Junior Girl Scout Day in which the girls had the opportunity to earn
            their STEM
            Career Exploration Badge, as well as their Crane Design Badge. It was a great introduction into concepts
            that are used
            everyday by engineers. This semester, we are planning a similar event in which the girl scouts can earn
            their
            Investigator Cyber Security Badge and Balloon Car Design Challenge Badge. The event will take place in
            person on April
            27th, from 6:00pm-8:00pm.

          <h4>Brownie Girl Scouts
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Brownie Girl Scout committee plans one event each semester for scouts in grades 2-3 that lead them
            through
            interactive activities to earn a STEM related badge. In December, our virtual program went through the three
            Automotive
            Engineering badges: Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing. This semester, we are excited to transition back
            to in
            person programming and will be hosting our event on the Cornell Ithaca campus on April 30th. We will lead
            scouts in
            brainstorming, sketching, and building a plane to earn their Mechanical Engineering: Fling Flyer badge. Our
            goal is to
            introduce young girls to the world of STEM and inspire them to pursue activities relating to science and
            engineering in
            the future!
