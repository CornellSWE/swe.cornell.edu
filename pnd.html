          The Cornell University Society of Women Engineers proudly presents our semiannual

          Professional Networking Dinner in the Statler Ballroom.
          Held the evening before Cornell's technical career fair,
          the Professional Networking Dinner enables company representatives and students to
          interact in an intimate yet relaxed environment. This allows representatives to share
          personal and business experiences while seeing first-hand just what Cornell has to
          offer. Students have the opportunity to speak to representatives for an extended period
          of time and to learn more about the workplace environment of many top engineering
          companies. We cordially invite you to join us for this unique networking opportunity.
          <br /><br />
          Spring 2020 company registration is now open!

        <h4>Company Representatives</h4>
        <p>
          The event will cost $200.00 for the first company representative and $180.00 for each
          additional representative. Please note that each company is limited to a maximum of 4
          company representatives. Companies may also choose to purchase an advertisement
          to be included in the program. Half page ads (5"x4") cost $50 and full page ads (5"x
          8") cost $70. Dinner and four networking rotations will allow you to meet a wide variety
          of students in a casual and friendly atmosphere. Representatives are invited to stay
          an additional half hour, until 10:00pm, for further networking. This is a wonderful
          opportunity to get to know potential full-time and internship applicants prior to the career
          fair.

        <p>
          Tickets are $15 and may be purchased online with a credit card. The dinner consists of
          a four course meal catered by The Statler, with four rotations, during which you will be
          able to network with different companies in a relaxed environment. Additionally, there
          will be a short networking session prior to the start of the official rotations, and a thirty
          minute networking session at the end of the night so that you will have the opportunity
          to speak to any representatives that you may have missed, or would like to talk to again.
          This is a great way to meet company reps and find a summer internship, co-op, or full
          time job.
