              Classes officially end at 4:25pm each day. Career Services would like to
              standardize session times, and so we will be offering sessions at 4:30pm, 6:00pm
              , and 7:30pm. For engineers, Tuesday and Thursday evenings are preliminary
              (midterm) exam nights. To avoid possible conflicts, please see the fall
              preliminary exam schedule or fall final exam schedule. Exams for the
              following courses are large lectures and tend to be busy times for
              engineers: MATH 1910, 1920, 2930, 2940, PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214, CHEM 2090,
              CS courses, ENGRD courses, and ENGRI courses.

              Although we can provide you with a number, we feel that it is better for
              companies to anticipate their attendance as you will know best what your
              turnout would be. The average number of students is typically 30. The base
              prices for the refreshment options are determined by this average number.

              One week prior notice to SWE Corporate Relations Directors
              (cornell.swe.cr@gmail.com) is required for cancellations.
              Cancellations made 7 days or less than the date of the session will
              result in a charge of half of the base price of a session. Less than 24
              hours notice will result in a charge for the full price of the session.
              If you cancel at least 7 days prior to your scheduled info session,
              you will be fully refunded.

              Professors who make requests for academic purposes have priority

              reservation. We will send out emails and announcements to students about
              the location change. Additionally, we will post signs and have a
              liaison to redirect students to your new session location the day of your

              In order for SWE to provide the highest quality service, all session
              details must be finalized at least one week prior to the desired date.
              Ordering food and reserving a room is never a problem, however, it does
              take one week for room requests to be processed and confirmed. At least a
              week is necessary to properly publicize an information session and ensure
              the session has sufficient number of liaisons and volunteers. Since session
              details may take several days to finalize - especially if you have
              any questions about the session options - we recommend that session requests
              are made at least 14 days prior to the desired date.
