            <h2>Professional Netowrking Dinner</h2>
            The Cornell University Society of Women Engineers proudly presents our semiannual Professional Networking
            Dinner in the Statler Ballroom. Held the evening before Cornell's technical career fair, the Professional
            Networking Dinner enables company representatives and students to interact in an intimate yet relaxed
            environment.

            <h2>WE Conference</h2>
            National SWE Conference is held in a different
            city every year and attended by over 15,000 attendees. It's an awesome opportunity to
            network with other female engineers, attend educational talks that range from imposter syndrome in the
            workplace to better decision making, and participate in the world's largest career fair for women engineers.

            <h2>Women in Engineering Day</h2>
            Every year we run Women in Engineering Day for accepted students, where we seek to expose admitted
            women to the opportunities at Cornell and the influence and strength of our section of SWE.
            We seek to foster a welcoming environment for our newly accepted students and
            celebrate their accomplishments.
